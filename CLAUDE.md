# ultracua — working notes

A Computer Use Agent: **learn a browser flow once, replay it deterministically at 0-LLM, 5–10× faster,
failing LOUD on drift.**

## Read this first

**[docs/open-defects.md](docs/open-defects.md) — the standing defect register.** THREE rounds. Rounds 1–2
(30 findings) are fixed; **round 3 found 11 more in the 387 lines those fixes added, 1 critical, and
refuted NONE of them.** Two are regressions the fixes introduced. Defect density in fix code measured ~3x
the code it replaced, so **a patch on a patch is the thing to be most suspicious of here** — three round-3
findings are the same shape as the finding they were fixing, one level down. When you close something,
change the shape so the invariant is enforced ONCE rather than adding another per-branch test.

**Two of round 3 were answered that way in 0.73.0** (R3.1, R3.4): two transcriptions of a JS snippet
became one, and a return type that could only say "absent" learned to say "unreadable". **A third
(R3.2, write attribution) was built, audited before merge, measured to have introduced a CRITICAL
regression, and reverted** — read that section before touching attribution, because it rules out every
purely temporal design and points at the causal signal `recorder.py` has had since Phase I. **Nine
remain open.**

**Audit the fix, not just the code it fixes.** The reverted redesign was green — 754 tests,
`drift_bench` clean, every regression test verified to fail against the pre-fix source — and still
critically wrong. Three rounds running, fix code has been the defect source; the only thing that has
ever caught it is an adversarial pass aimed squarely at the new code. Run one before you open the PR,
not one release later.

## The three inviolables

Violating any of these is a blocking defect, not a trade-off:

1. **Replay never calls an LLM.**
2. **Never silently return or act WRONG — fail LOUD.**
3. **Write safety** — never double-submit a write, never silently suppress one.

## How work is done here

- **`uv` for everything.** `uv run --no-sync pytest tests/... -q`, `uv run --no-sync python -m benchmarks.X`.
  Never bare `uv sync` (it strips groups) — use `uv sync --all-groups`.
- The full suite is **key-less** — real headless Chromium against local fixtures, no API key, ~18 min
  (it grew from ~15 when 0.73.0 added a per-step attribution drain to the learn path). It must be green
  before a commit.
- **One slice per PR**, branched off `main`, single-sourced version bump in `pyproject.toml` first
  (then `uv sync --all-groups`). The user reviews and merges; don't merge.
- Secrets are env-resolved and **never** serialized, logged or written to disk. Never paste a key value.
- Keep large/working data off `C:` (`D:\ultracua-data`). `.env`, `.ultracua`, `.scratch` are gitignored;
  `baselines/` is committed.

## The suite is regression-shaped — measured, and it matters

Nine mutation tests (one per defect class this project has shipped) are ALL caught, entry-point coverage
is broad, and the tests flagged as unfalsifiable turned out to be fine. The suite is not weak. But
**mutation testing only probes guards that exist, and every defect here has been a guard that was
MISSING** — ~44 findings across three audit rounds, *not one discovered by the suite*. It proves known
bugs stay fixed; it cannot fail for a bug nobody has thought of.

So when you fix something in write safety, add a DIMENSION to
`tests/test_write_safety_invariants.py` — which asserts the inviolable as a property over a
cross-product — rather than only a bespoke test beside the fix. And note both halves are load-bearing:
without the "must remain learnable" clause the property is satisfied by refusing everything, which is a
regression that actually shipped. When you build such a matrix, PRINT what each cell exercised before
believing it; two drafts of that file looked thorough while testing nothing.

## Two habits that have repeatedly paid off

**Reproduce before fixing.** Several reported defects have been misdiagnosed — the symptom real, the stated
cause wrong. The most recent: an audit blamed a row anchor's substring matching when the anchor never ran at
all. A fix built on a wrong diagnosis is worse than none.

**Verify a regression test fails against the old code.** A test that passes both before and after proves
nothing. This has caught several no-op "fixes".

## The pattern that predicts the next bug

Most defects found here are **a guard that already exists on a sibling path and was never applied to the
mechanism** — the replan path guards something the heal path doesn't; the recorder guards something `learn()`
doesn't; `heading`/`label` anchors were hardened and `row` wasn't. When you fix one, check its siblings.

## Measurement, not assertion

`benchmarks/drift_bench.py` (key-less, ~60s, CI-gated) is the instrument for any change to `locators.resolve`
or the recovery ladder. It reports a 0-LLM survival curve by mutation intensity, per-tier recovery rates, and
`silent_wrong` — which must stay within its published allowlist. Use it to *adjudicate* a resolver trade
rather than argue it; that is what it was built for. `baselines/README.md` states plainly what each number
does and does not prove — keep that honesty when adding to it.
