# Discovery-reliability baselines

Standing benchmark records captured with the variance harness
([`benchmarks/variance.py`](../benchmarks/variance.py)) against a **real LLM** (Anthropic), so
later changes — most immediately **best-of-N authoring** (Tier-2) — can be measured and gated against a
fixed reference instead of a single noisy run.

| File | Bench | Captured | Headline |
|---|---|---|---|
| `demo.json` | demo-shop (4-step) | 2026-06-19 | 5/5 replay, speedup **86.3× ± 20.9**, ~$0.27 — no discovery variance (cost/speedup reference) |
| `miniwob.json` | MiniWoB++ ×10 | 2026-06-19 | replay success **52% ± 13%** (40–70%), pass^k=0 (no rep got all 10), ~$4.24 — the discovery-reliability reference |

The MiniWoB number is the one that matters: it's where LLM authoring is unreliable (the bottleneck),
so it's the headroom best-of-N should close. The demo flow authors reliably (no variance).

## Re-running / gating

```bash
# Re-measure and FAIL (exit 1) if replay-success regressed beyond the error bars, or cost rose >25%:
uv run --group bench python -m benchmarks.variance --bench miniwob --reps 5 --all --baseline baselines/miniwob.json
uv run python -m benchmarks.variance --bench demo --reps 5 --baseline baselines/demo.json
```

Notes:
- These use a real LLM (key from `.env`) and are **manual/local — never wired into CI**. ~$4.5 for the
  pair above.
- The gate compares `replay_success_rate` (machine-independent) and total cost. `speedup` is recorded
  but **not gated** — it's an in-process micro-timing that depends on the machine.
- `pass_k` here is strict ("a rep passes only if ALL its tasks pass"); the per-task `replay_success_rate`
  mean is the more actionable discovery-reliability signal.
